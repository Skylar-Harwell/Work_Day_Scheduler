# Work_Day_Scheduler

## What you doing?

A simple quick schedule for use for today, not yet tomorrow, only today. Maybe later we have have it set up for tomorrow, and the next day. And another day. But for now only today.

Enter your event that you need to set a reminder for at the specific time you set. Then just click the blue save icon on the right of the line to save that item. Accidently closed out the page? No worries! The event stays there when you reopen the page again. Event over? Then just simply remove the text from the field and then click the blue button to save and it goes back to the default "Enter Event".
